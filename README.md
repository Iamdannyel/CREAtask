This repository contains the results of the data science projects completed for the CREA Russia Fossil Tracker assessment. The projects cover infrastructure setup, data collection, data processing, and data visualization tasks. Here's a summary of each task:

Infrastructure: We have provided configurations for internal monitoring and external alerts to detect potential fraudulent shipments. Refer to the monitoring and alerts directories for details.

Data Collection: A Python CLI application is available to scrape historical data for Brent, Urals, and Dutch TTF indicators from the internet. Check the data_collection directory for instructions.

Data Processing: Using the assignment_flows.csv file, we estimated monthly gas consumption for each country. The data_processing directory contains the code and a chart showcasing the results.

Data Visualization: In the data_visualization directory, you'll find scripts and charts representing trends in Russian fossil fuel traded volumes by region and commodities since the war began.
